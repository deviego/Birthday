## Email Transporter 
- This micro service, is to send an email to a network of users.
- But in this case it's to help with my mother's work
- my mother manages a cosmetics franchise and needs to keep an eye on the birthdays of the monthand so I decided to use programming for this.

##
<h2>Function</h2>
- It uses the Gmail port to send emails to whoever I want

##
<h2>Future</h2>
- I will use this code to alert my mother about the birthday boy
- I will automate the sending of promotional emails from her company
- will be used as information within her system
- I will use it for my smart home
- Among other features that I need in the future
